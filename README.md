gti.py
======

Just a silly `git` launcher, basically. Inspired by `sl`.

Install
-------

This is a port of the original [gti][], but written in Python. Just
copy it somewhere in your `$PATH`. It should run fine on Python > 2.3.
It is a perfect fit for `$USER/bin` folders, so you can easily put it
in your [`.files`][.files] repo.

[gti]: https://github.com/rwos/gti
[.files]: https://github.com/gsamokovarov/.files

Usage
-----

Try typing `git` really fast, on an unfamiliar keyboard.
